k,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmkllllllllllllllllllllll  <that was my Nabi-the-feral-cat's contribution>

There are 2 actors:
Admin - persona will be Nik. Nik will also be "Family". Nik likes the systems she builds/administers to be useful and help you fail elegantly. Nik lives in Seattle with the occasional Asian foreign students and Nabi, the slightly feral cat.
Family - personas will be Pops, Tishy and Wolf:
>>Pops is 76, not very keen on social networking other than sending rude jokes by email but he may come in if it is very safe. Pops lives in Aylesbury, Bucks, England with Zebedee the very fat indoor/outdoor cat and Monster-cat (who is actually very loving) who always lives outside.
>>Tishy is 40, doesn't have time to use social networking but would come in to help remember everyone's birthday's and current addresses. BUT only if it is very very simple. Tishy lives in Pitt Meadows, BC, Canada with her family and Zoom the beastie dog
>>Wolf is 7 almost 8, he lives on the computer and will be very rude about the first attempts to build this. But I love him dearly and he may be willing to test.  He will want to communicate with his cousins in Boston, MA and if I could build something interactive he may be a little proud of me.  Wolf lives in Pitt Meadows, BC, Canada with his family and Zoom the beastie dog.

Assumptions:
Everyone has to log in to do anything useful as the information is private
Admin can do extra things but I am not sure what at the moment :)
DBA work is carried out in a suitable tool like Toad etc, therefore out of scope of noodle

Here are the first thin slices to deliver by sprint end:
1. As a Tishy I want to enter my personal data and see it pop up in the right month of the "book of days" page

Backlog:
It is in Trello https://trello.com/board/noodle/516cbe6ee0c9b5ad34000dc7
